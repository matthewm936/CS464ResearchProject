Opens a python GUI where users are prompted to click start then can hit keys which track accuracy and completion time for hotkey like keystrokes.  Change the global vars NUM_TRIALS and MAX_KEY_COMBO to change the total number of keystroke entries the each iteration of the experiment (python main) will run and the MAX_KEY_COMBO determines the number how hotkey complexity (via the total number in each) that the experiment will go up to
